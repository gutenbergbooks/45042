<p class="center">THE PRAISE OF FRIENDSHIP.</p>


<p>Tregurtha and Roscoria are friends. Tregurtha is, as his
name sufficiently indicates, a Cornishman. He was also a sharp
lad, and, before his term of residence at his first dame's school
was fairly run out, he cut his cables and escaped to sea. To this
act of insubordination he had been instigated mainly by Louis
Roscoria, a small schoolfellow, his junior by several years, and
his stanch adherent. The two had shared a room, done each
other's lessons, worn each other's hats, taken each other's floggings;
and, in short, the devil himself had never come between
them. But they parted pretty soon, for, encouraged by his
young friend's energetic support, Dick Tregurtha made haste to
follow his destiny and infuriate his parent by running away to
sea. Small Roscoria, who was the good boy of the school and
always got the prize for conduct, saw his friend well on his way,
wished him God-speed, exchanged pocket-knives with him, and
then lay on the grass kicking his heels, and howled in his grief
until he got caned for refusing to tell what had become of Tregurtha.
The friendship thus grounded on mutual services has
never been broken.</p>

<p>Dick once wrote from foreign parts an elaborate apology. He
said he was sorry, but the sea was his god, and he hoped his father
would overlook it. He added that, whether on sea or land,
he trusted to be no discredit to the name Tregurtha, and ended
by very properly observing, as boys do, that, since he had carved
out his own line of action, he should feel his honor engaged to
make it a successful one.</p>

<p>Tregurtha's rather crusty parent did not overlook it. On receipt
of this letter he presently called the rest of the family together
and thanked God that he was rid of a knave.</p>

<p>Meantime, Roscoria went to Eton, thence to Cambridge. He
behaved after the manner of most brilliant men: showed a reluctance
to give his mind to what was definitely expected of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
him, and scored heavily in exams, by some thoughtful rendering
of a knotty point in Plato, or by striking ideas based on private
reading of the German metaphysicians. He was far from being
idle, but he took too æsthetic a pleasure in his work, and vexed
the souls of middle-aged dons.</p>

<p>Subsequently Roscoria (who of course left Cambridge without
an idea as to his future) went abroad to tutor the sons of an
Englishman in Rome. He remained there a year, after which
time his father died, and left Louis Roscoria, sole descendant of
an old family, owner of a meager estate in Devonshire, and possessor
of means perhaps in proportion to his merit, but nothing
over.</p>

<p>Even scapegrace Tregurtha was better off, for his bodily wants
were provided for on board a ship; and though promotion
loomed very vaguely in the distance, yet his immediate salt pork
and future were assured.</p>

<p>Suddenly a brilliant and Utopian notion occurred to Louis the
Philosopher. He was a bit of a philanthropist, and hopelessly
romantic, and had been pained by public-school immorality. He
was also an unpractical man by nature. So he resorted to his
present employer, Mr. Rodda, also a Devonshire man, and said,
"What if I set up a school?"</p>

<p>"On your own account, man? Why, you would be ruined!"
cried old Rodda, over his port.</p>

<p>"I doubt it, sir," responded Roscoria, gayly. "You forget
that moldy old house of mine. I shall never be able to let it, unless
to an incurable lunatic, and it is too large for any decent
bachelor to live alone in. Good! I fill it with a set of boys. I
teach them on an entirely new and original system&mdash;<i>and</i> make
a little money, which I need not tell you, sir, is wanted in this
quarter."</p>

<p>"I would lay you any money, if you had it, young man, that
you fail," said Mr. Rodda, comfortably (he was a little "cheered"
by this time;) "but if you are bent on the experiment, and as I
have a high opinion of your principles, though none of your
judgment, there is my youngest son, Tom; we can make nothing
of him at home, and I don't believe he will ever be any good, so
you may just take him as a beginning."</p>

<p>"No, really, sir? You are too good," said Roscoria, flushing
grandly with the inflatus of ambition. "I believe much can be
done with boys by taking them young, and if I succeed with
dear Tom&mdash;nothing ought ever to baffle me again."</p>

<p>Roscoria settled down in his ancestral home at the head of a
collection of such boys as a private tutor will generally get&mdash;awkward
boys in temper, vicious boys, hopelessly dense boys,
backward boys, idle, wool-gathering, foolish, blockish boys.
Two lads had been expelled from Eton, but Roscoria thought
himself a born reformer. A third youth had been recently superannuated:
he was for ballast, Louis said. At first the young
schoolmaster governed the wild set gently, having great faith
in boyhood. Afterward he fell one afternoon upon a passage
in Plato: "If he is willingly persuaded, well; but if not, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
bent and twisted tree, they make him straight by threats and
blows."</p>

<p>Blows! Happy thought! "The influence of my mind and
character on theirs has failed," Roscoria thought. "Go to,
now; let us see whether there be not some animal magnetism
by which a lad may be drawn toward the good." And Roscoria
felt up and down his strong young arm, and knew a complacent
sense of muscle.</p>

<p>At this time Roscoria met again, and liked as well as ever,
Dick Tregurtha.</p>

<p>Tregurtha had grown sun-browned, tall, and broad. Tregurtha
had merry blue eyes and a winsome grin. One was happy to
shake hands with a man who was obviously on such good terms
with his own heart and conscience.</p>

<p>"You helped me to run away from school, you know," he
said, holding out his hand to Roscoria when they first met
again.</p>

<p>"Yes; did I serve you well by that?" asked Roscoria, who
had grown into what our ancestors called "a pretty fellow,"
with features as correct as his own morality, and a pair of
dreamy black eyes.</p>

<p>"You did; I've not forgotten it. Here is your knife in
token."</p>

<p>"And here is yours. Come and dine with me."</p>

<p>And the two young men got into a corner and foregathered
together, and the friendship renewed by romance was riveted
firm by reason.</p>

<p>This is the one important feature in these two young men,
and the one point that distinguishes them from others. Now
passionate natures know no "friends," nor commonplace ones
either. A friend is only granted to philosophers.</p>

<p>When a sociable hunting-man asked the other day, "How do
you make a friend? I never had one; I never wanted one," at
least he knew what he was talking about. And indeed, few
people want a friend, and there are many other sentiments to
satisfy the unworthy. Is not love perennial, a thing as common
as June roses? Acquaintanceship is necessary; affection is
a partially inevitable state. But friendship ever was, as it is
now, the rarest gift beneath the sun. Ask any one, all the
same, who has ever known an assured friend, whether he would
give him up for any pleasure or profit.</p>

<p>Why, see how the theme of Friendship makes even Montaigne
serious and eloquent. Observe how it has attracted great minds
of all descriptions. If Byron could be brought to affirm that
"Friendship is love without his wings"&mdash;well, there <i>must</i> be
something in it.</p>

<p>Friendship is for two of the same sex, during the difficult
period of middle life. Of course the friendship should have
been formed during youth, but then it will have been kept in
abeyance, as it were, gradually forming into a solid rock to rest
upon after the quicksands of love have been settled somehow.
Then will it be found:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A living joy that shall its spirits keep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When every beauty fades, and all the passions sleep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No wonder it is rare, for if such a glowing glory of content
were often known among us, this world would grow too orderly,
and men would all be angels for the sake of Friendship!</p>

<p>"Tregurtha," said his friend one summer evening, "to-morrow
is a holiday. The boys are all off on various expeditions,
assisted by boats, donkeys, butterfly nets, or tins with worms.
Even that little plague Tom Rodda is going, under the charge
of a trusty sailor, for a day's shrimping. Now, in the midst of
this general mouse-play, what is to become of the cat&mdash;meaning
me? The pedagogue ought to go off on the spree like every one
else. I am sure he is the hardest worked. You are with me;
let us somehow celebrate your arrival ashore. We must go
somewhere not haunted by the boys. Boys are my aversion, as
you know; besides, if one meets them abroad they are in mischief.
One has to cut up rough, and the result is that greatest
of earth's failures, a spoilt holiday. What say you, O comrade,
to a day's fishing in the Lyn?"</p>

<p>"I don't say much," replied Tregurtha; "but if you will excuse
me, I shall go and look up my flies."</p>

<p>"6.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Don't oversleep yourself," said Roscoria, chuckling
youthfully, as he shook Tregurtha by the hand.</p>

<p>Hard as disciplinarian Roscoria ever found it to arise on work-a-days,
when getting out of bed meant reading prayers in a
stentorian hoarse voice, and then administering an hour's Greek
before breakfast, no such difficulty attended his leap from the
arms of Morpheus when he heard Tregurtha's thundering knock
on this most halcyon Saturday.</p>

<p>"Propitious heavens, keep but this face all day!" was Louis'
greeting to as fair an angler's sky as ever ushered in a holiday.
Off clattered the companions in a hired and rakish-looking
vehicle; Tregurtha in the front seat chaffing the driver, and
Roscoria on an insecure perch behind, swinging his legs, beaming
on his fly-book, and altogether presenting an aspect of
radiant boyishness wholly incompatible with his grave scholastic
calling. Up and down they went, walking up the hills to spare
the worthy horse, dashing down them in true Devonshire
fashion; past woods and down to the sea at Lynmouth, there to
alight, drink cider, and buy fishing tickets. Then on again,
rolling along the beautiful road to Watersmeet, where the trees
were all in brightest foliage and the wildest flowers thick amidst
the grass. The morning sun was sucking up the rain of last
night from the glittering leaves, and a pensive breeze hovered
in the air, causing the birds to sing.</p>

<p>"Hey, Roscoria! but I hope it's not too bright!" was the remark
the glory of the day evoked from his companion.</p>

<p>"Tregurtha, do not tempt the gods; the day is heavenly, and
if we do not dine on trout to-night&mdash;&mdash;" The remainder of Roscoria's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
song of praise was abruptly cut short, for in assuming
too negligent an attitude for greater convenience of harangue he
had overbalanced himself, and now lay prone on the road some
twenty yards behind. Having picked himself up and dusted his
hat, Roscoria reascended in more cautious vein, whilst the driver
cheered on his horse, reflecting on the probable results of matutinal
cider on a youth whose ordinary "habit" was the Pierian
spring.</p>

<p>After what seemed to these artists of the greenheart-wand an
unconscionably long, though lovely drive, the lowest point was
reached where it is of any use to rig up a rod&mdash;namely, that nice
little field through which the river runs so sweetly, just before
you come to Brendon. Here our two holiday-makers descended,
with many a parting gibe at their good-natured jehu. Then
down they sat in the moist grass, after the manner of men under
thirty, and out each drew a bulging pocket-book. Thereafter,
silence, save for such murmurs as: "Hallo, I don't believe this
reel runs smoothly!" "Where <i>is</i> that penknife?" "Tregurtha,
lend us a blue upright if you value my happiness!" and so on
in that delightful, half-excited talk that precedes trial of one's
luck.</p>

<p>Noon approached; the two young men were fishing steadily,
separated by several pools; now and then they passed each other
with a cheery jest or an absent-minded greeting, according as
they happened to be engrossed in their sport, or only idly lashing
at the water. Now Tregurtha was on in front, in a fragrant
meadow, with some interested lambs for his spectators. He was
musing sleepily as he cast his line, for fish in the Lyn do not run
very large, and Tregurtha's sport, though he had a dozen nice
trout in his basket, was not of a nature to claim the highest
powers of his intellect. An unexpected rousing came to him,
however. A large and goodly fish rolled over suddenly and took
the fly well in his mouth, then plunged for the lower depths and
lay there sulking. Tregurtha was at once all promptitude and
energy. He threw a stone to move the wary trout; he left it
alone; he gave it a tentative jerk; he tried every means to persuade
or frighten his victim into stirring, but it all seemed useless,
the fish was obstinate. Tregurtha was just beginning to
wonder whether he should have to walk in and <i>fetch</i> his trout, or
whether he would take a seat and wait its pleasure, when the
matter came to a crisis. One of the inquisitive young lambs,
which was very tame, and thought Tregurtha was the farmer's
lad, dashed suddenly in between his legs with a bound, after
the sportive manner of its race.</p>

<p>Tregurtha stumbled, let the point of his rod down for an instant,
recovered his footing, and hastily rectified his position.
Alas! is it necessary to state that the line flew up flippantly into
the empty air, and the fly settled on the top bough of an alder
hanging over the opposite bank. The fish&mdash;well fishes, unlike
human beings, know how to use an opportunity; this trout was
off to the dentist to cure him of a toothache. Tregurtha was
not an irritable man; he did not swear; he did not stamp; he
turned to the mischief-working lamb and said: "Is this your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
vaunted innocence, you horrid little meddling beast?" and then
he whistled softly to himself, rubbed up his rough hair all on
end, and stood still, looking rueful.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me how to woo thee, love!" sang suddenly a sweet
voice round the bend of the stream, and then a break occurred
in the song, and the singer petulantly exclaimed, "Oh, bothered
be these stones forever; they are so slippery!"</p>

<p>Tregurtha's rod fell from his paralyzed hand as round the
corner came, wading through the shallow part of the running
stream close to the head of the very pool he was fishing, a
maiden! Yes, and a lady too, though her gown was caught
up and thrown over one arm, displaying as its substitute a short
striped skirt of brilliant coloring, and her lovely feet shone
white through the sunlit waters as unconsciously she stepped
along.</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy on me!" Tregurtha thought wildly, as
he stood rooted to the spot, marveling meanwhile why he did
not cast himself into the deep pool before him. The inevitable
moment came; the damsel lifted her large dark eyes and saw
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg&mdash;I beg&mdash;I <i>beg</i> your pardon!" almost roared Tregurtha
in the excess of his manly bashfulness.</p>

<p>What did the maid? Blushed crimson first, and stared at the
intruder with a speechless horror, letting drop, by instinct, her
pretty overskirt. Then she turned quickly, seized the branch of
a large oak-tree and tried to raise herself by it to the opposite
bank, where, once arrived, she could have vanished in a second
through the wood. Alas! as she clung to the bough, the traitor
broke, and down went the maiden, with a shivering cry, under
the surface of the water. Well, at any rate, here was an occasion
where a man need not feel an idiot, nor like Actæon before
the wrath of Artemis. Tregurtha felt a sense of positive
relief as he plunged in after the lady, and dragged her out
and on to her much-desired bank, all breathless, faint, and
frightened.</p>

<p>"I wonder now what on earth you would like me to do for
you?" Tregurtha asked, depositing his burden respectfully upon
a mossy seat.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah!&mdash;thank you. I think you had better perhaps go,"
the maiden answered, panting still for breath, and shaking her
dripping hair.</p>

<p>"You are faint. You would like&mdash;at least, no, not some
water&mdash;you have had enough, and I&mdash;I dare not offer you some
whisky. There's your poor hat still in the water. Oh, gracious!
to think of my spoiling all your pleasure in this way."</p>

<p>Tregurtha seized upon the hat, squeezing the water out of it
(much to the detriment of its shape) as if it were the juice from
an orange. Reduced to a pulp of straw and muslin, he brought
it to its mistress, who, smiling, said, "This hat has seen many
a wild frolic, but I sadly fear this most embarrassing, though
amusing, incident has finished my companion, and it will cover
my foolish head no more. I must go home, or I shall catch a
cold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"But pray accept my apologies&mdash;my most sincere and humblest
apologies," began Tregurtha.</p>

<p>"I beg you will not mention&mdash;&mdash; Oh dear, dear!" The damsel
burst suddenly into uncontrollable, resistless laughter. "Please
<i>could</i> you keep away, right round the corner, until I fetch my
boots? I am so sorry to have interrupted you in your, no doubt,
successful fishing." Here she glanced inquiringly at the line
caught and mazily entangled in the alder bush. "Good-morning,
sir."</p>

<p>Tregurtha blushed deeply, bowed and strode away as though
avenging Fate were at his heels&mdash;away over the meadow,
through its little gate, along the road, down to the river again,
where Roscoria stood coolly, immersed in hopes of monster
trout.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow; why, you've been wading! Fish gone?"
asked Louis.</p>

<p>"Fish be &mdash;&mdash; I've had such an experience, Roscoria. I have
seen a lady!"</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, Tregurtha! is that so unusual? Why, man,
you are almost pale! Tell us your wonderful story."</p>

<p>Tregurtha did so, "with stammering lips and insufficient
sound," whilst Roscoria opened his basket and took therefrom
an ample lunch, besides displaying the trout he had caught.
"They are not large," he said, surveying the fish affectionately,
"but they are very beautiful. And now, friend, are you too
much overcome for mutton sandwiches, or will you try a limb
of that blessed duck that old Rodda sent down?"</p>

<p>"But, Roscoria," murmured Tregurtha, as he ate, "I am
afraid you don't quite enter into the extreme indelicacy of the
situation!"</p>

<p>"Far be it from me," retorted Louis&mdash;"cake, Tregurtha?"</p>

<p>"Not with duckling, thank you. The lady&mdash;her feet&mdash;I should
say her boots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were off, I understand," quoth Louis, dryly. "Hallo! is
this the lady?"</p>

<p>He alluded to the appearance of a very small girl, bare-foot,
grave, and chubby, who wandered into the meadow from an adjacent
farmyard, and stood as near as she dared go to the sportsmen,
gazing with friendly, covetous eyes on their outspread repast.</p>

<p>"Child," said Roscoria at last, "do you like cake?"</p>

<p>The infant nodded her head solemnly, her big eyes brightening
the while.</p>

<p>"Then take hold of this and be merry," replied the pedagogue,
extending an ambrosial slice. The small child hesitated
after the manner of her sex and age, hung her head, bit her
tiny fingers, and finally advanced and received the donation.
She did not seem at all inclined to go, but stood solemnly
munching by Roscoria's side as he reclined on the grass, and she
did not prevent the crumbs from falling down his neck, which
was not pleasant.</p>

<p>"Child," said Roscoria again, "you may sit down." Down
sat the wee lass comfortably enough, and gazed into Roscoria's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
fine black eyes as if she had not often seen so goodly a gentleman.
Roscoria endeavored hard to meet her stare, and for five
minutes or so he succeeded; but those two serious blue eyes
embarrassed him at length, and, turning to Tregurtha, with a
somewhat nervous laugh, he observed, in Greek, that the infant
was alarming to him, and that he should be compelled to
hide his eyes within his robe. "Who gave you&mdash;I mean, what is
your name?" Tregurtha asked the baby. True to her training,
the child arose, shook out her frock, and made a courtesy,
whilst she answered, with effort to remember:</p>

<p>"Hanner Marier."</p>

<p>"Then Hannah&mdash;or Anna&mdash;Maria, would your mother give us
each a glass of cider, think you?"</p>

<p>"Should <i>you</i> like some?" inquired A. M., as she sought Roscoria's
face again.</p>

<p>"Dearly, my lass."</p>

<p>Anna Maria showed she could move; she positively darted
home, to return much slower, and with a portentous gravity of
demeanor, bearing in tremulous hands one glass of cider held
very tight. But to whom to give it? There lies a sad struggle
for her between duty and inclination. She glanced yearningly
at Roscoria's dark head, propped up expectantly on elbow, then
she measured Tregurtha's noble length stretched out beside his
friend. Slowly, reluctantly, but overpoweringly came the truth
upon her youthful mind: Tregurtha was the taller, <i>ergo</i>, in her
infant logic, he&mdash;the elder&mdash;must the first be served. Without
waiting an instant, wee Hebe gave the Cornishman his due,
and fled away again. Once more she came, more careful even
than before; and, with a nascent spark of coquetry in those
rustic eyes, she smiled and said: "And this, sir, is for <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Here's your health, my bonny lass!" cried Louis, raising the
glass to his lips. "Long may those cheeks of yours retain their
roses, and may you ever be as able to look a decent man in the
face!" Anna Maria, not quite comprehending this ovation,
turned so earnestly serious, and so riveted her intent gaze on
the handsome countenance of Louis, that the unfortunate
young man could stand fire no longer, and ended his refreshing
drink by the most ignominious fit of choking.</p>

<p>"You had better go, my dear," interposed Tregurtha hastily,
slipping a shilling into the child's hand; "he isn't used to so
much admiration."</p>

<p>Anna Maria reluctantly departed, with many a backward
glance at Louis, who, when the firm young feet had borne his
small admirer solidly away, threw out his arms with a groan
of intense relief and said:</p>

<p>"By Heaven, Tregurtha, there is great power in the human
eye! I feel completely mesmerized."</p>

<p>"What a thing it is to be good-looking!" observed Tregurtha,
lighting a cigar. "Now, I wonder how stands the heart of this
young Adonis? Has he yet learnt that the proper study of
mankind is woman?"</p>

<p>Roscoria laughed, tumbled down into the soft grass again,
and meditatively responded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall end like Shelley by finding all modern love unsatisfactory,
because of an ideal attachment to Antigone. The
lady of this century talks too loud; she cannot laugh either.
She is matter-of-fact; she has an eye to the main chance."</p>

<p>"You are fastidious, my boy. Case of Narcissus over again,
I imagine."</p>

<p>"Don't you be an old fool, Tregurtha," said Louis, more
pleased than he liked to show by the implied compliment. He
rolled lazily to the verge of the river, and was just about to examine
his own visage, when he suddenly caught his friend's eye
of malicious criticism, and, after affecting to have seen a trout
in the water, jumped up and said "Come along!"</p>

<p>"Hallo! my rod. I forgot. It is still adhering to an alder."</p>

<p>"Fetch it, then."</p>

<p>"I daren't."</p>

<p>"Still fearing the silver-footed Thetis? Why, man, she will
be far enough by this time! But if that is the case, matters are
easily settled; I'll go."</p>

<p>Roscoria went off accordingly, wondering what on earth he
would <i>not</i> do for Tregurtha, and, when he had waded the
stream, climbed the tree, disentangled the line, and substituted
other flies for those which had been jerked off, the two anglers
started at a brisk walk to go further up the river.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant country this, in which to spend a summer day.
The trees are very magnificent and full of foliage; the glens are
bold and varied; and the river-courses glittering through many
a winsome spot. With good sport, light hearts, intense capacities
for enjoyment, the two young men spent a rare afternoon,
to be long remembered in their winter evenings as one of the
brightest of their holidays. They were approaching toward six
o'clock the boundary of the famed Doone Valley, where they
owned the fair spell of the enchanter Blackmore, who, with his
poetic wand, has conjured up the past for us, and haled dead
men out of their coffins to live again and be famous beyond the
wildest hopes of their lifetime.</p>

<p>Then, whilst musing by himself, Roscoria chanced to notice a
churlish coolness in the air, a depth of shadow from the neighboring
oak, a meaning hush and quiet stealing all about; and
all he said to the deepening beauty of the summer eve was
this:</p>

<p>"Hang it all, I must put up my rod!" Sitting with his back
turned to the river that he might not be tempted, Roscoria did
so slowly, to give Tregurtha as many extra seconds as possible.
He then went to fetch his unwilling companion, who had to be
hauled from the bank by the coat-collar; then off and away to
the place appointed for Jehu to meet them, and home in contented
silence to the Young Gentlemen's Academy. The supper
consumed within the halls of Torres that night was truly
Homeric. Witness the behavior of the cook. She was an energetic
woman; but she sank down at last upon the nearest chair,
and, wringing stalwart arms in desperation, cried, "May the
Lord stay their stomachs, for I cannot!"</p>

<p class="center">THE GODDESS.</p>


<p>One sultry afternoon Roscoria&mdash;the vices of boyhood vexing
overmuch his burdened heart&mdash;betook himself to green meadows
with a volume of Plato. He had announced his intention of
reading in the same until he had cooled down, a process which
usually took him precisely three hours. Long before he was expected,
however, he was heard by Tregurtha coming along the
bridge over the moat toward his front window, and presently he
sprung in by the same, with an excited look in his eyes and the
manner of a man who has a fact to tell.</p>

<p>"Save you, Tregurtha! I am hit hard," was his greeting.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Tregurtha, politely, looking up from
a piece of carpentering.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear, Dick, of love at first sight?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and a very shady proceeding it always seemed to me,
if, indeed, it be not a chimera. But, Roscoria, you are not feeling
anything in your head, are you? Giddiness, perhaps? A
feeling as if you had lost your memory? I hope it's nothing
serious; but, my dear fellow, the sun was rather hot when you
started."</p>

<p>"You great ass! I tell you it is not the head that is affected;
it's the <i>heart</i>."</p>

<p>"Same thing, dear boy."</p>

<p>"I have seen, Tregurtha&mdash;I have seen an Olympian goddess
treading the grass of a nineteenth-century field!"</p>

<p>"You've seen a milkmaid!"</p>

<p>"Richard, if I thought I could annihilate you, I would try.
She was majestic, pensive, golden-haired, distracting; a daughter
of the gods, I swear."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I think you had better take it easy," interposed
Tregurtha anxiously. "Take the armchair near the window,
and open your grief. There really is no hurry."</p>

<p>Roscoria was at last induced to sit down, Tregurtha standing
by him, with bent brows of perplexity, in his shirt-sleeves, with
his hammer still in his hand. Louis began his recital by a
torrent of Greek, comparing his mysterious goddess to almost
every heroine of antiquity, and using so great a multitude of
compound adjectives and fantastic turns of speech that his
hearer faintly seized a newspaper and fanned himself therewith.</p>

<p>"As it is some time since I was at school, Roscoria," interpolated
his friend on the first opportunity, "you will excuse me
if I do not quite follow you. If you could speak English mainly,
I would pardon the use of a few Grecisms."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Roscoria, "and, by Jupiter, will try to
speak of her in English. Listen. I was taking my solitary
ramble through a field skirting a beautiful little wood of Sir
John Villiers', filled with wild hyacinths. I had my eyes fixed
on my book for a long while, but when I lifted them, what think
you, friend, they saw?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the way in which you have carried on, I should imagine
a woman."</p>

<p>Roscoria looked up in admiration at his friend's sagacity.</p>

<p>"She came straight by me, walking softly and dreamily, looking
aside at the blue hyacinths, and her hat was held in her
hand, so that the sun shone on her wonderful hair till it scintillated
like a shower of gold. She was tall, yes; but she had an
air so ethereal, and in her white dress she showed so like a
cloud, that I held my breath lest she should vanish. I thought,
indeed, she was some mystic vision I had conjured up from
Plato's pages&mdash;the Absolute Good she might have been&mdash;she was
so fair, so spiritual, and the air was so still around us; and there
were we alone in the summer silence."</p>

<p>"Did she speak?" inquired Tregurtha (for he was a sailor, and
his friend's manner was impressive).</p>

<p>"When she saw me standing still before her she dropped
her eyes and made for a gate leading into the wood. The fastening
was troublesome, so I went and opened it for her. She
turned as she passed through, and bent her head&mdash;with a queenliness,
heavens!&mdash;and smiled and whispered a word of thanks.
I saw her eyes then for an instant; they&mdash;but I ought not to
speak of them, and, after all, I don't know what color they
were. She walked a short distance whilst I was shutting the
gate again, and I was not the man to spoil her solitude, so I
went off very fast; but looking back just once&mdash;only once, Tregurtha&mdash;I
saw her standing amongst those blue-bells, gathering
them, whilst the sunbeams slanted through the pale green larch
boughs on to that glinting, golden head. After all, what immense
possibilities this world contains! I believe this&mdash;this
vision to have been the daughter of a mortal man who was once
a <i>boy</i>, probably also a schoolboy! But then there was a woman
in the case."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old fellow," said Richard, consulting his watch:
"this has been very instructive; just as good as 'Half-hours
with the best Poets;' but I suppose we must all descend to
commonplace. You must tone yourself down and come to
supper."</p>

<p>"Supper!" gasped Roscoria, blankly.</p>

<p>"Supper," retorted Tregurtha, firmly. "You shall note that
not all your boys are overcome by an <i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i>, and that
if you keep them waiting much longer there will be a bread
riot. Here is comfort for you. The Tremenheeres give a tennis
party; hie you to it, and if this Oread of yours be mortal,
she will surely there be found. It is a good way to distinguish
women from angels: the former, if young, can scarcely resist a
party."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE WAY TO TAKE A PARTY.</p>


<p>In the interval between the evening mentioned and the day
of the tennis-party, Roscoria was out early and late, whenever
his calling permitted, roaming restlessly in the woods, haunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the sunny fields like a dark shadow, seeking for his goddess in
the spot where he had seen her, and in every other romantic and
flowery nook that he thought likely. Of course he never saw
her. If he had been his own cook, the venerable Mrs. Tartlett,
if he had been his youngest pupil, small Tom Rodda; if he had
been the parish blacksmith, or cowboy, or even the parson&mdash;a
<i>paterfamilias</i>&mdash;he would assuredly have seen her. But as he was
her lover, and was searching for her high and low, he never
caught so much as the glimmer of her fair white robe dim in
the distance.</p>

<p>Consequently, Roscoria grew irritable, knowing the pangs of
baffled will, but he did not lose his hope. He could have sworn
that he should meet her again. So on the important day he got
himself up in white flannels and pre-Raphaelite red cap, caught
up his racket, and ran off. Half-way toward his destination
he wisely slackened his pace, lest, meeting his charmer, he
might be too much out of breath to speak to her. As he crossed
a field not far from the hallowed locality where he had lost his
heart, he stopped short and passed his hand across his eyes.
Yes; surely she was no other! A tall form, walking in that
dreamy, quiet, contented way that he had noticed before; in a
white dress&mdash;<i>the</i> white dress&mdash;and there came the sunlight down
on her golden hair as she passed from under the shade of that
oak. She held as a screen a large horse-chestnut leaf, and she
stooped often to gather or to scrutinize some wild flower. It
was the same lady, and the charm was the same. Roscoria
began by an impulsive start after her, then he stopped again,
for what could he possibly say? He could not rush forward and
exclaim, "Lady, you are the most adorable creature beneath
the sun&mdash;what is your name?" for that would sound <i>bizarre</i>, not
to say impertinent. As he was thus musing, however, a chance
occurred in his favor; drawing out her kerchief the unconscious
maiden let an envelope slip from out her pocket and
fall noiselessly in the grass. She walked on unwitting, but Roscoria
saw his opportunity, ran up and seized the letter. It was
addressed to "Miss Lyndis Villiers."</p>

<p>In the first fervor of his satisfaction Roscoria imprinted a
chaste salute upon the letters of her name; then, looking again
at the handwriting, he observed, with a sharp revulsion of feeling,
that it was rather manly in character. Perhaps he had
kissed his rival's ink! With a shiver Roscoria proceeded to
make the most of his time. He walked up after the lady, doffed
his small cap, and said, "Excuse me&mdash;this is your letter, I
think?" The lady gave a slight start, and received her property
with a gratitude much tempered by the haughty surprise
of the Englishwoman when addressed by a stranger. Then she
blushed, for she recognized the handsome stranger. And then
there seemed nothing more to be done, and Roscoria's wits were
hampered by his admiration of her, so she bowed and went her
way. This was well; but her way happened also to be Roscoria's,
and he walked faster than she did; moreover, there was before
them a stile, and beyond that stile the only lane, a narrow one,
toward the Tremenheeres. He walked behind, like a footman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
until the delay at the said stile obliged him to come up with the
lady. Then, as he clomb the barrier and noted the narrowness
of the lane below, a sense of the comic struck him hard,
and he burst into a cheery, irrepressible laugh. Much
pained he was with his own irreverence when he had done so,
but Miss Villiers turned at the sound, and smilingly accosted
him as she stood in the lane, looking upward:</p>

<p>"I fear I detain you; go on, you walk more quickly than I."</p>

<p>So brilliant an idea now flashed into Roscoria's brain that he
saw blue sparks before his eyes for several minutes afterward.</p>

<p>"You have a racket to carry; as we are bound in the same
direction, apparently, may I&mdash;&mdash;?" Her lips parted for thanks,
so Roscoria was over the stile with the dexterity of an acrobat,
and next moment was walking by his goddess' side, her rackets
in his hand, in the most blissful tremor.</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you my name to show you that I am respectable,"
he began. "I am Louis Roscoria, an instructor of
youth, and owner of that curious, moldy building, Torres
Hall."</p>

<p>"That beautiful, ivy-grown, moated mansion, with willows
growing all round?"</p>

<p>"The same, if you call it beautiful."</p>

<p>"I have sketched it several times from a distance already"
(beatification of Roscoria!), "although I have only recently come
to live here. Of course I know your name. Have you not a
great friend, a Mr. Tregurtha?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" cried Louis, "and I am glad that people connect
the fact with my name."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Lyndis, looking up with kind eyes;
"you two are called 'Damon and Pythias.'"</p>

<p>"I dare say. I am awfully proud of Dick (that's Tregurtha,
Miss Villiers); he is a fine fellow, and he manages me completely.
Whatever he suggests seems to be better, somehow,
than what I can think of myself. It's his <i>nature</i>, you know;
there's no system about it whatever: that's just where it lies.
He has a way with him; I have no way with me; and all the
Philosophy in the world won't give me one. Only, I hold that
he makes one radical mistake in judging of my system of education:
he won't let me thrash my own boys when he can help
it, which I think is rather hard on any preceptor."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is!" said Lyndis, sympathetically; "but I dare say
you are too fond of correction, or whence this dudgeon at being
debarred from it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash; But if there is such an anomaly as '<i>righteous</i> indignation,'
what a fervor of godliness must the sight of the
average boy excite in the breast of the right-minded schoolmaster!
And can indignation find a better vent than blows?
Why, even the long-suffering Moses had to break something
when he found his Hebrews dancing round a calf!"</p>

<p>"I would not adopt a profession which develops the indignation
to so great an extent," said Lyndis, rather amused by her
companion's impetuosity.</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Miss Villiers; whatever we have most at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
heart will disgust us sometimes. We have our ideal (or we
ought to have), and the reality is coarse, indeed, in comparison,
but it is better than nothing at all; and is it not in itself an ennobling
thing to be constantly engaged in a tremendous struggle,
whether the vantage be to you or no?"</p>

<p>Roscoria looked at Lyndis with a far-away intensity and a
sad determination of expression, which made her think she had
never seen so enthusiastic a young man.</p>

<p>"It is a glorious vocation, teaching," said Lyndis, gently.</p>

<p>"It seems so when you praise it."</p>

<p>Lyndis here grew a little absent-minded. She could follow
him when he talked of his boys, but when he began on this new
vein of sentiment she knew she must begin to dictate to him
what he should say next. So she observed that the weather was
fine, a fact that Roscoria had noticed before.</p>

<p>"It is the finest day I ever saw in my life, as well as the happiest,"
he replied loudly, and with fervor.</p>

<p>Beautiful Lyndis! she looked up with those starry eyes of
hers and&mdash;begged his pardon! So the poor young man was
obliged to pretend he had said something else. And there they
were at the Tremenheeres' gate already, and Lyndis, with a
somewhat more distant smile, took her racket, passed through
the tiresome gate, and was lost amongst the laurels, whilst Roscoria
hesitated. He did not attempt to follow her, but, after
speaking a few words to his host and hostess, went in search of
Tregurtha.</p>

<p>Now Tregurtha, though he had started a quarter of an hour
after his friend, and taken the longer route by the circumambient
road, instead of going across country, had&mdash;for some reason
inexplicable except to very young people&mdash;arrived long before
Roscoria, and was disposed to be foolishly jocose upon the subject.
Louis checked this tendency in his friend, though with
some difficulty; and Tregurtha grew somber as he recounted the
boredom of his experiences over a set of tennis, wherein his
antagonists had dawdled about without any manner of spirit,
whilst, as he himself was the best player on the ground, his
partner naturally was the worst. Observing that Roscoria grew
lax in his attention to these plaints, Tregurtha went and hovered
aimlessly around a tea-table. He was speedily dislodged from
this refuge by the hostess herself, who stormed up to him with
a rustle of silk akin in sound to the spray of a mighty cataract,
and an all-conquering inflation of demeanor peculiar to the
grandees of Devonshire and Cornwall, and, seizing him by the
arm, bore down upon the other end of the long <i>salon</i> with him
in tow.</p>

<p>Tregurtha was a Cornishman himself, so he was equal to the
occasion&mdash;drew up his height and adopted an attitude of breezy
and elegant ease as he listened to Mrs. Tremenheere lisping
something about a "Miss &mdash;&mdash;" (he could not catch the name),
"introduce&mdash;very clever&mdash;not my style&mdash;pretty though&mdash;&mdash;"
etc., until she stormed off again, leaving Tregurtha anchored
opposite a small but rather stately foreign-looking damsel, of
pleasing exterior, with a pair of great soft blue-black eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
which were gazing up at him with an expression of absolute
fright. The occasion did not seem to warrant this nervousness,
and Tregurtha was just thinking to himself, "What a shame
to bring her out just yet! she looks so young and shy," when
the maiden before him turned hastily round and slipped out
by the French window on to the lawn, laughing consumedly.
That laugh! he knew it. Dick pursued in hot curiosity and
identified her. This was she&mdash;the heroine of the stockingless
episode&mdash;this was Thetis&mdash;this was Arletta of Falaise.</p>

<p>"I think we have met before," quoth he, not without relish
of the joke. But the lady of the hyacinthine eyes was too
deeply conscious of that fact to enunciate a syllable. So there
they two stood together on that almost deserted lawn (let us not
be compelled to explain that every one else was drinking
claret-cup!), under the heat of that summer sun, for several
silent moments; and the man was losing his heart.</p>

<p>There was magic in the air that afternoon, for out came Roscoria
presently (looking very much <i>en l'air</i>), and with him a
tall, fair-haired woman, who only wanted wings. Tregurtha
forgot himself in an instant, and, laying his hand on Louis'
shoulder, led him up to Thetis, impressively and proudly observing:</p>

<p>"Miss &mdash;&mdash;, allow me to introduce my friend" (with emphasis)
"Louis Roscoria!"</p>

<p>"Keeper of the Wild Beasts' Asylum, Torres Hall," murmured
the said Roscoria, irreverently. "I have been deputed to arrange
another set; shall we four play?"</p>

<p>Tregurtha gave vent to a muffled cheer, and the quartet
marched (with some unseemly haste, lest other men should take
their bishoprics) to the best ground, and there began. Tregurtha
and Roscoria were noted players; together they were, in Devonshire
at least, invincible. In a single, Tregurtha had the best
of it.</p>

<p>The set was exciting. At first the two sides won game for
game. Lyndis, as a tennis-player, was grace personified. She
looked so lovely and moved so lightly that it seemed a marvel
why hers was not always the winning side. Roscoria, too, exerted
every muscle, and writhing about with the cleverness of a
lively cobra, ought to have done wonders, but he tried too hard,
and lost. Tregurtha, with less grace, had a longer reach and a
greater power of hard hitting, so he turned to his partner about
the fourth game, saying, "We will win this set, I think," and proceeded
to do so. His partner was a capital player, shirked no
balls, and had a prompt little way with a back-hander, which
looked spirited and was useful. It was she who won the set
(said Tregurtha), for it was she who returned Roscoria's last serve,
with the twist on, by a malicious little slant just over the net,
where the ball fell almost a yard before the feet of the goddess
Lyndis, who beamed with gracious impotence upon it.</p>

<p>The baffled pair, Roscoria and Miss Villiers, strolled to an
arbor, and there sat talking. It might have been ten minutes
that they sat there&mdash;as Roscoria thought it was&mdash;or it might
have been an hour and ten minutes to boot. Anyhow, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
heaven. There sat Lyndis Villiers in a low wicker chair, all
embowered in fragrant honeysuckle, and looking herself like
pink eglantine with her gold hair and soft rose cheeks. The
admiring sunlight played on her dress, all snowy white, save
where a pretty caprice had moved her to place a bunch of
glittering buttercups. There she rested, one hand round a branch
of honeysuckle, her eyes still, kind, and peaceful; her voice
sweet and calm, speaking her very thoughts, and those such
wise and pure ones! There was Lyndis, the Ideal realized, and
there opposite sat Roscoria, clasping his knee in his hands in
deep preoccupation, not himself at all, nor conscious of himself,
but "a self aloof, that gazed and listened like a soul in dreams,
weaving the wondrous tale it marvels at." He only knew from
time to time, as her voice ceased, or her head was turned away
for a moment, that he had come under one of those divine madnesses
which the gods send upon men; that life grew more
wonderful every moment, and that ever after he should be able
to say&mdash;I have once been happy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tregurtha and his partner of the white face and
dark eyes were eating strawberries in an adjacent hayfield. It
was pleasant there also, and the damsel, for all her grave looks,
was playful, and conversation was uninterrupted. "Tell me a
sea story," she asked, after a little desultory persiflage had been
exchanged; and Tregurtha settled himself on a large haycock
and began to recount his own adventures in various storms and
casualties on the ocean, just as he told them to Roscoria's boys
at night. And as he did so, his blue eyes kindling, and his
hands closing and unclosing with the excitement of memory and
the thought of the wild sea wind, he caught full sight of the
blue-black eyes of his hearer, who had come nearer and was
watching and listening to him with parted lips. She reminded
him of a woman he had known years ago in Spain, who died;
and those eyes struck a sharp pain to his heart, so that he finished
his story with his hand over his brow to keep them from
him. So, as he did not look again at her, Rosetta quietly finished
all the strawberries, for she was, as yet, very young.</p>

<p>A loud, impatient halloo aroused them both, as a stout, warlike,
flurried, elderly gentleman came puffing indignantly
through the tumbled hay (most like a threshing machine), much
encumbered by a large feminine shawl, which he carried on his
arm, and shouting to Rosetta:</p>

<p>"Why, why, dash it, my love, I call this insubordination, you
know. Didn't I tell you an hour you should have and no more?
And how long do you suppose you've kept the horses waiting?
I can tell you, madam, you're the only human being who dare
keep Admiral Sir John Villiers' carriage and himself waiting in
this way. How d'ye do, sir? I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
Sailor, I see. Of course! didn't I know what the tattooing
on your wrist meant? Got an anchor on mine, sir. Confound
your impudence, miss, what are you laughing at? Oh!
the shawl&mdash;stuck to my coat-button, has it? Well, and if it has;
have you no reverence, you saucy minx? Put it round your

<p>Thus was Rosetta swept off from the glances of her first admirer
by Admiral Sir John Villiers, the owner of Braceton
Park, renowned as the most awkward customer in Devonshire.</p>

<p class="center">THE GODDESS IS HUMAN.</p>


<p>The friends found their way home together in the cool of the
evening; both very quiet, but Roscoria evidently meditating
some deep design. At night, growing confidential as they patrolled
the garden, smoking, Louis proceeded to rave of his goddess
"for an hour by his dial." Tregurtha heard and nodded in
silence. He was a more reserved man than his friend, so he did
not even mention the maid who ate his share of the strawberries.
Indeed, he forgot her whilst listening to the outpourings of his
ingenuous comrade.</p>

<p>"I shall never be any good at my work, I'm afraid," complained
Roscoria; "that beautiful face is the only thing my mind
will comprehend."</p>

<p>"Well, if I were you, as you seem so far gone, I should
take some steps," advised Dick. "I'm no friend of shilly-shallying.
If you love the girl, go and tell her so, I advise."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd more money," sighed the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Many a good <i>paterfamilias</i> has wished that before you,
my lad," observed Tregurtha, with a laugh. "How does the
country curate get on with his six children, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"Eh, I don't know. O Lord! I hope I never shall be the
father of a <i>boy</i>!" exclaimed the pedagogue, with a sudden
agitated glance up at the bedroom windows, as the dread
crossed his mind that he might have been overheard all this
while.</p>

<p>However, all objection melted before the warmth of Roscoria's
attachment, and one night he gave up his keys and authority
to Tregurtha, bade him bolt the shutters and troll out
prayers to the household in his jovial bass, for Louis Roscoria
was going to a ball to "declare himself."</p>

<p>He had found out all about Lyndis (or thought he had). She
was the niece of Admiral Sir John Villiers; her father dead;
her mother married again to a hunting, racing type of man who
wanted no stepdaughter about. So fair Lyndis was staying
with her uncle for the time, looking after the housekeeping in
return for his kind protection. But Roscoria gathered much
hope that his suit might possibly be the means of relieving her
from any unsettled feeling that she might have about her future.
And thus it came to pass that at the termination of their fifth
dance together they were sitting in a ferny grotto&mdash;the goddess
was all robed in blue this time, as if she had brought down a
piece of summer sky trailing after her&mdash;and Louis began all at
once to show the tenderness he felt.</p>

<p>There was a little of the usual fencing with the subject, and
then Roscoria came out with a few leading questions. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
heard rumors&mdash;very disquieting rumors&mdash;in short, would she
set his mind at rest?</p>

<p>Lyndis bent the glory of her mystic eyes upon him for an instant,
whilst she said:</p>

<p>"I was going to be married, but we were obliged to put it off.
Where are you going, Mr. Roscoria?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Louis miserably. He had risen and
taken a few steps away, but he came back again and leant
against the wall by her side, breathing quick and brokenly.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned Roscoria, "I wanted you."</p>

<p>He heard no answer, so he straightened up and took her kind
hand and said, "Never mind; I was a fool not to be silent; but&mdash;but&mdash;if
you had known your own charm, would you have
made me so unhappy?"</p>

<p>Then there seemed a light in her eyes which was not there
before, and a whisper was borne to him low and far away as
if it were the echo of the voice of Fate thousands of years ago:</p>

<p>"By the favor of Heaven I am free!"</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Louis believed he heard himself saying,
"Why did you forsake him, for <i>he</i> never did it?"</p>

<p>"The admiral forced the match upon me&mdash;he is so arbitrary!
I consented in a cowardly moment; but that was before I had
seen you. The gentleman I was betrothed to saw I was not
contented before even I knew it myself; he himself volunteered
to release me. Of all the unselfish men I know, Mr.
Rodda is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>("The deuce he is!") thought Roscoria to himself. "<i>Not</i> Eric
Rodda, Miss Villiers&mdash;the young fellow I tutored at Rome!
Brother of Tom? Poor fellow! I feel like a brute, somehow."</p>

<p>"No use to feel so, Louis; it was all over before ever I saw
you."</p>

<p>"'Louis'&mdash;you darling! Could you put up with a very
modest style of existence&mdash;at Torres? You said you admired
the situation."</p>

<p>"Oh! are you poor?"</p>

<p>"The proverbial church-mouse is a Rothschild to me."</p>

<p>"What a cruel thing that is!" sighed Lyndis; "when the admiral,
my mother, my stepfather, all insist on my marrying a
rich man."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear lady, go and do it in Heaven's name!" cried
Roscoria, and at sight of her surprised face he said, repentantly,
"I beg your pardon&mdash;Lyndis&mdash;darling."</p>

<p>"Which do you put first?" asked Lyndis, smiling sweetly,
"Obedience or Love?"</p>

<p>"Love," emphatically responded Louis.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Roscoria, and you a schoolmaster!"</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Villiers, tell me, do you prefer the main
chance, or me?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I am no lover of abstractions."</p>

<p>She came a little toward him as she said it, and he had her
hand again.</p>

<p>"This dear hand&mdash;shall it be mine?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>No answer, save that propitious starlight in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Lyndis, one kiss, that I may know you are mortal."</p>

<p>"I daren't," she said, and gave him one. "If the admiral
<i>were</i> to come round the corner&mdash;&mdash; I say no more."</p>

<p>She gave him a stephanotis from her hair to keep as her favor,
and then whispered apprehensively:</p>

<p>"You have no idea what a naval officer can be when he takes
to match-making. I shall have to fight this out some day with
him."</p>

<p>"No; allow me," said Roscoria.</p>

<p>"If you dare; but&mdash;<i>this</i> is after supper."</p>

<p>("Oh, how <i>can</i> you?") expostulated the lover.</p>

<p>Then, being a serious maiden, who knew what she was doing,
Lyndis pressed his hand and quietly, but finally, spoke:</p>

<p>"Mr. Roscoria, go home and think it over."</p>

<p>She had stepped into the brilliant light of the ballroom, and
vanished from his sight. Roscoria went home as in a dream. A
shifting picture was before him&mdash;in front, smiling scenes of bliss
and love; in the background, Nemesis, in the garb of a naval
officer.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE ADMIRAL IS SQUARED.</p>


<p>Admiral Sir John Villiers was of all landowners the most
peppery. He could not keep on terms with the farmers, his
tenants; he never attempted to be on terms with his relations,
and his warlike attitude toward the owner of the adjacent
property of Torres was notorious. A man so revelling in storms
as the admiral must needs have <i>some</i> quarrel with his next-door
neighbor, and the subject-matter is easily found. A bit of land
contested, a dubiousness of fence, and behold Sir John Villiers
rampant. The makings of a despot had the admiral; he was
kindness itself (in his imperious way) so long as he was not
crossed; but oppose the most reasonable of wills to his and England
itself, let alone Devonshire, was not large enough to contain
him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was Roscoria who happened to be the next-door
neighbor, and very warm the admiral made the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Roscoria loved every inch of Torres, and held his own with an
iron grip. The admiral took it into his head that a corner on
the boundary of the two properties belonged to himself, and he
set himself to wrest it from Roscoria. A little representation
and cajolery he tried first, then threats, for he did not mean to
be ousted by an impudent young puppy like Louis Roscoria.
But the owner of Torres stood firm.</p>

<p>The relations were thus a little strained, when a glorious piece
of strategy occurred to Louis the lover. He had just declared
himself to Lyndis, and had received her assurance that she
loved him in return, and would marry him gladly could the admiral
be squared.</p>

<p>So Roscoria arranged a dinner at Torres Hall, Tregurtha and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
two or three others to be present, and then went over himself to
invite the admiral. Sir John Villiers hemmed and ha'd, and
would have curtly declined to enter the young man's house, but,
scenting the battle afar off, and hoping for a good rousing tussle,
he consented, grimly.</p>

<p>Some fine old port came up from the cellar of Torres, and a
very jolly party Roscoria and Tregurtha managed to make of
it. The admiral, who came in at first snuffing haughtily and
twirling his eyeglass with the most warlike aspect imaginable,
was soothed and smoothed as the wine went round, and at last
began to tell stories.</p>

<p>Propitious circumstance! Need we say how the young men
roared with laughter at indifferent naval anecdotes, and greeted
one effort at an august pun with clamorous applause? Tregurtha
burst forth at last, followed by the others, into the
<i>Lobgesang</i>, "For he's a jolly good fellow!" and this was the signal
for Roscoria to edge himself confidentially close to the admiral
and insinuate:</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, we are all convinced of this, and it makes me
all the more regretful that there should be any&mdash;any small mis&mdash;mis&mdash;understanding."
(Roscoria here grew very nervous, and
stammered a good deal.) "Fact is, Sir John, we all think here
that things could be most comfortably settled if&mdash;if you could be
content to make one small sacrifice. You have a niece&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sacrifice, sir, if any is made, must be on <i>your</i> side,"
quoth the admiral, kindling; "though I don't deny that if you
were to marry my niece it might thus be made to my full and
complete satisfaction."</p>

<p>"Precisely, Sir John; and in that case, without further difficulty,
I give up to you the 'boundary-plot,' which, I am afraid,
you have long wished to possess."</p>

<p>"Wished, sir&mdash;<i>wished</i>? It is mine!" The admiral smote the
table with his fist; the glasses jingled; he remembered the port,
and, drinking some, was cheered.</p>

<p>"Yours, Sir John&mdash;yours from this moment if you consent to
lay Miss Villiers' hand in mine," Roscoria spoke with ardor;
the other men gathered round with interest, and the admiral
saw he was expected to say the handsome thing. He rebelled at
first.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "your hospitality is of a somewhat
treacherous character."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir John," retorted Roscoria. "I believe I have
made you an honorable proposal. If it takes place whilst you are
drinking my wine, well, sir, all that I can say is&mdash;I trust you find
the port is good."</p>

<p>"Excellent&mdash;excellent. I have no fault to find with the wine.
The wine, sir, is unexceptionable. I wish only I found your offer
the same."</p>

<p>"Come now, admiral," interposed Tregurtha, good-humoredly,
"what's a niece? You are rid of a tiresome responsibility, and
the lady gets an honest husband."</p>

<p>"H'm! honesty is his <i>forte</i>, is it? Shouldn't have thought it,"
muttered the admiral; but he was giving in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is one objection," he said, moving uneasily. "Miss
Villiers is under age; but then girls are headstrong nowadays.
What if she declines?"</p>

<p>"Ah! she'll not decline," said Roscoria, with a joyous ring in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir! Then there has been a little clandestine love-affair
between you already, has there? The hussy!"</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>, admiral, we don't generally make our first tentative
advances in the presence of the guardians&mdash;now do we?" put in
the ready Tregurtha.</p>

<p>"I suppose not, you rascal; I suppose not," said the admiral,
and pen and paper were laid before him.</p>

<p>"Now mind, Sir John," Roscoria warned him jocularly,
"this transaction may not be strictly legal; but there is such a
thing as the Court of Honor. I am sure of my own intentions,
I can guess at the lady's, and this writing is to hold you to
yours."</p>

<p>The admiral only nodded impatiently, and wrote down in good
set terms an agreement to give his niece in marriage to Louis
Roscoria on condition of that landowner and his heirs forever
resigning all claim of ownership to the boundary-plot of Braceton
Park. He threw the paper across to the young men to
sign as witnesses, and then returned to his glass and his yarn.
The old fellow's somewhat shaken good-humor was quickly restored.
He was finally put into his greatcoat and sent home in
his brougham, feeling vaguely uncomfortable, but softly singing
a nautical ditty.</p>

<p>Roscoria knew no discomfort nor repentance, but danced the
hornpipe with Tregurtha.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ROSCORIA'S BETROTHED.</p>


<p>Rosetta Villiers was looking very uncomfortable. She had
taken a seat opposite to her uncle, the admiral, and was cross-questioning
him with a certain sternness, before which the old
sinner was quailing considerably.</p>

<p>"Mr. Roscoria made you this offer, you say? It is most extraordinary:
I scarcely have seen him."</p>

<p>"Why, Rosetta, he gave me to understand&mdash;at least, he hinted
at something like an <i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i> between you."</p>

<p>"Affaire de fiddlestick!" cried Miss Villiers, rising in real indignation;
"the man <i>must</i> have been exceeding! Why, upon
my word, the conceit of these young men! I suppose, passing
me in the lanes once or twice, he was slightly taken with my
looks, and supposes me to have been equally entranced by his.
I should really like to see him, uncle, to give him a piece of my
mind."</p>

<p>"Well, that is the most sensible thing you have said, Rosetta,"
agreed the admiral, "for you must anyway see this fellow, and
make it up with him somehow, to save my credit as a man of
my word. I admit it's a deuced awkward business, but since I
consented to it&mdash;in cold blood mind, Rosetta, I repeat that I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<i>not</i> had too much&mdash;I am bound to stick by the contract, and I
suppose you, being included in it, are at least called upon to
bear me out."'</p>

<p>"I never knew such a fearful scrape!" cried Rosetta, with a
rush of despairing tears to her eyes. And then, being very
brave of nature, she shook herself together and pondered. She
was a real child still, only sixteen, and had never been much
in the company of older ladies. She was, therefore, quite unprepared
to enter upon any matrimonial plans of her own,
and&mdash;clever as she was&mdash;dwelt in surprising ignorance of the
world. No course then could her inexperience suggest, except
that of saving her uncle's reputation by adhering to the contract.
And as she thought and accustomed herself to the
strange idea, her young face lighted up with humorous smiles,
and she threw up her head with a delightful sense of enterprise.</p>

<p>"Sir," she began, turning solemnly upon the shamefaced admiral,
"I feel that you have treated me with scant consideration,
and plunged me early into the difficulties of a matronly
career. Nevertheless, such is my care for the family reputation
that&mdash;I'll marry Louis Roscoria!" she concluded, with a
sudden gust of laughter.</p>

<p>"Yes; he is learned, is he not? And I remember him as very
good-looking," she added, with a blush; "large, soft eyes, if I
am not mistaken. I <i>suppose</i> one can fall in love, given a man
so handsome. <i>Allons&mdash;essayons!</i> But if I don't give it him
for this abominable deception, then I don't feel the blood
of my Spanish ancestors on the mother's side coursing vigorously
through my veins! Sir, I consent."</p>

<p>The admiral (who was honestly afraid of his spoilt niece)
confounded himself in thanks and praise, and privately thanked
also his stars that his ward had grown up so unsophisticated.
With that tricksy Spanish spirit of hers, had she taken this affair
in a different light she might have got me into fearful
trouble, he thought, softly whistling directly the descendant of
the hidalgos had turned the corner.</p>

<p>Next day was fixed for Roscoria's introduction. On hearing
the complete success of his stratagem, Louis arrayed himself
regardless of expense and hastened to Braceton Park. He gave
Tregurtha leave to follow him in an hour&mdash;"to be introduced to
the lady, who, I suppose, will then be my betrothed," he said.</p>

<p>Admitted into the drawing-room, Roscoria was left alone for
what seemed to him an awful while. He grew nervous, and
fluttered at every sound in the room. The clock annoyed him
inexpressibly, and he started every time he faced a mirror. At
last, in despair, he clutched his hat and stick, and sat down in
orderly stiffness with his back to the door, and tried to abstract
his thoughts. But they would dwell on his Lyndis, and it was
no use to try and "sit like his grandsire carved in alabaster."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a light sound of approach, and a tremulous,
sweet voice close to his ear said simply:</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, Mr. Roscoria."</p>

<p>Louis bounded on his chair as by galvanism, dropped his incumbrances,
and spread forth a pair of eager arms, into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Rosetta, thinking this was all in the day's work, was actually
preparing submissively to walk, when he saw that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>"Ten <i>thousand</i> pardons!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Rosetta, smiling. "It is quite natural that
you should feel deeply upon an occasion like this." And then
she rubbed her small hands together bashfully, and waited with
a beating heart for the beginning of his courtship.</p>

<p>"But I hope you see my mistake," urged Louis, still in smiling
embarrassment. "I took you, in fact, for another lady."</p>

<p>"But; I <i>am</i> the other lady," said Rosetta.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;Miss Villiers I was expecting."</p>

<p>"Precisely, I am Miss Villiers," said Rosetta, with firmness.</p>

<p>Roscoria looked the lady in the face. She was a very young
looking creature, small, but rather strongly made, with a striking
white face and great blue-black eye with a latent, passionate
fire in the very depths of them. She had a resolute small
chin and a decided mouth. Louis thought her, spite of her prettiness,
the most tremendous interlocutor he had ever met. He
turned absolutely faint with sudden horror, and grasped a chair,
saying feebly:</p>

<p>"But Miss Villiers was tall and fair."</p>

<p>"Oh, my cousin do you mean? Yes; she will be in directly.
But&mdash;but"&mdash;(Rosetta's face grew whiter and her eyes larger with
the shock of discovery)&mdash;"you did not mean <i>her</i>, surely?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me&mdash;I did&mdash;and do."</p>

<p>"Then allow me to assure you, Mr. Roscoria, that the admiral
did <i>not</i>. My cousin, Lyndis Villiers, is his niece and guest
merely; it is I who am his ward since my father died in a naval
engagement. He has made a very natural mistake. Lyndis is
supposed to be out of the question, being engaged to marry a
former pupil of yours&mdash;Mr. Eric Rodda. The admiral of
course assumed that you meant me when you made your extraordinary
request. I may mention that I thought it odd at
the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! oh, Lord! I am punished this time!" groaned Roscoria,
and, without even keeping up a pretense of ceremony, he
sank on the table and sat there, rocking himself backward and
forward. Rosetta laughed as one who had lost a load of care.
She was now free to rejoice at the misfortunes of another, and
for the first moment could not resist doing so. She stood opposite
Roscoria and laughed at him and his discomfiture, like the
child she really was.</p>

<p>"Not that I mean the least disrespect to you, my dear Miss
<i>Villiers</i>," apologized Roscoria, out of the depths of his lamentations;
"if only, like my predecessor Jacob when in a similar
predicament, I could take <i>both</i>, how glad, how thankful I should
be! But as it is, dear Miss Villiers, your cousin is so much to me&mdash;and&mdash;I
thought I had got her!&mdash;in short, I know you will excuse
me."</p>

<p>"Excuse you? Why, I am so thankful myself!" breathed out Rosetta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks: it is very kind of you to say so. It makes it much
easier for me," sighed Roscoria, gratefully.</p>

<p>At that moment enter the admiral, walking sideways and
fumbling with the door-handle as one who fears to interrupt a
<i>tete-a-tete</i>.</p>

<p>Roscoria came forward in penitent guise, and began to explain
the unlucky mistake that had arisen, and how it was Miss <i>Lyndis</i>
Villiers toward whom his heart had yearned.</p>

<p>The admiral snorted. His temper arose. Both the young
people knew they were in for it. Sir John Villiers withered
them both with his sea-faring eye.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" exclaimed Roscoria, also a little irritably.
"If I tear up that paper, and leave you in possession of
that bit of land, and say no more of my marriage in connection
with it, but try to gain Miss <i>Lyndis</i> Villiers as a separate undertaking,
I suppose it will be all right?"</p>

<p>"Rosetta Villiers is an heiress, so if she pleases to throw herself
away on a poor school master&mdash;he's no worse than the good-for-nothing
military men who generally get the heiress&mdash;but Lyndis
Villiers has not a penny, and I owe it to my second brother's memory
to see that his orphaned child does not marry any impecunious
young gentleman. Besides, she is suitably affianced to Mr. Rodda's
eldest son. She is, therefore, out of the question."</p>

<p>"For the moment let us assume it," said Roscoria (who, we
remember, was better informed); "but in that case, naturally,
Miss Rosetta Villiers is free."</p>

<p>A very gentlemanly young man! thought Rosetta approvingly.</p>

<p>"I do not see it, sir," said the admiral, unfurling a handkerchief
like a challenge flag. "I will neither give up the field
nor permit you to go without your share in the bargain."</p>

<p>"Then give me a trifling consideration in money," suggested
Roscoria&mdash;"if Miss Villiers will kindly pardon my entering upon
such matters in her presence."</p>

<p>"That piece of land and my niece are, in my estimation,
priceless. Only the one, sir, is a sufficient substitute for the
other. Besides, I decline to have any shilly-shallying in this
affair. It will be all over the place to-morrow that Rosetta
accepted you and you threw her over."</p>

<p>"Let it be; I accepted the position," said Rosetta.</p>

<p>"I will <i>not</i> let it be," stormed the admiral. "If a young man
thinks he can play fast and loose with a niece of mine, let him
try&mdash;let him try!"</p>

<p>Here Rosetta, growing really frightened, hastily went out and
returned with sherry and biscuits, which she pressed upon Roscoria's
acceptance in the midst of his indignant rejoinder to her
uncle. Mechanically the young man received the refreshments,
and, holding his glass in one hand and taking a fierce bite of his biscuit,
he said loudly, and turning toward the lady, "I protest
again, Sir John Villiers, that I have not the slightest intention of
playing fast and loose with Miss Rosetta, and she knows it as
well as I do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>And the door opened, and Lyndis Villiers was in the midst of
them.</p>

<p>Now this time, of course, Roscoria was unnerved, and did
nothing but turn very white and set down his glass and look
away. Therefore Lyndis, hearing his last speech, seeing him in
excited converse with her uncle and her pretty cousin, and
eating and drinking as if he were there for the day, harbored a
deep suspicion of her lover. There was a painful silence.</p>

<p>Then the admiral began again:</p>

<p>"Lyndis, come here! Do you know Mr. Roscoria?" and
Lyndis lifted her clear gray eyes upon Louis and said, "Yes,
certainly."</p>

<p>Then Roscoria recovered himself and shook his beloved by the
hand, and murmured, "Good-morning, dearest; I am in an
awful scrape."</p>

<p>And Rosetta confided to Lyndis that the admiral was past
human guidance, and it was to be hoped that Providence would
interfere. Of course Lyndis knew nothing of what was toward,
and a laborious explanation had to take place, at the end of
which the tall, fair Englishwoman looked rather shocked,
and murmured something about "unjustifiable liberty," which
was directed at Roscoria. He took up the attack by a counter-charge:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you, as the admiral says, are still engaged to
Eric Rodda?"</p>

<p>Lyndis raised her eyes again to Roscoria's, this time with a
furtive memory of love-making in them, and responded decidedly,
"No, it is not."</p>

<p>"Sir," she continued, turning to the admiral, "Mr. Rodda is
coming this afternoon to break this to you."</p>

<p>"Break it to me!" irascibly exclaimed the admiral. "How
many more things am I to have broken to me this day? I
should like to break a thick stick to these fellows! Why can't
they stick to their engagements as I do? Precious attractive
they seem to find you two young women. I wonder you are not
ashamed, Lyndis, to come and tell me that your fellow has given
you the slip too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" expostulated Roscoria, and he dared&mdash;before the
admiral&mdash;to put his arm round Lyndis' waist.</p>

<p>"Look at them, sir!" said Rosetta, in a motherly aside. "I'd
go to the rack with Spanish fortitude before I would cross young
love."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Tregurtha!" announced the footman, and in
came Dick with an air of "Bless you, my children!" about him.
He was stopped on the very threshold, though, by recognizing in
Miss Rosetta Villiers a dear, if new, attraction.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he exclaimed. "Why, this <i>is</i> delightful, you know!"
and shook her warmly and long by the hand.</p>

<p>Rosetta ordered a fresh glass for the sherry, and Lyndis inhaled
the odor of the hyacinths in the flower-stand, whilst
Roscoria bent over her, earnestly engaged in making his
peace. The admiral, who had been quelled for the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
burst out afresh. In trembling accents he said, waving his
hand:</p>

<p>"Ladies, leave us, if you please!" and Lyndis and Rosetta,
knowing what impended, hastily made for the door, Roscoria
finding time to bow out his adored just before Sir John broke into
a torrent, a storm, hurricane, gust, squall, half-gale, great-guns-blowing
(or any other nautical simile) of language.</p>

<p>The young men listened with respectful disapprobation (for
to attempt to stem the course of the admiral's diction was at
all times dangerous). When the sea-faring gentleman's invention
was somewhat ebbing, Tregurtha was in an undertone
acquainted with its source. The moment when it seemed of
any use, Roscoria began again on his suit. He pleaded,
urged, lost his temper, found it again, represented, reasoned,
chaffed the admiral, appealed to his friend&mdash;and all in vain.
Lyndis was steadily denied to him.</p>

<p>"And Miss Rosetta?" asked the lieutenant; but this question,
which to him was most important, got lost, as totally
irrelevant to the matter in hand. In despair the tired and
heated Roscoria was gently led away by his friend, and the moment
they appeared out of doors they were cheered by the sight
of the ladies, who were waiting in the garden.</p>

<p>"It has not gone well with you, has it, Louis?" asked Lyndis
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Gone well! It has gone vilely, Lyndis. Why do you encourage
such a curmudgeon of a peppery old Cambyses as an
uncle?"</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> relative, if you please, sir," said the loyal Lyndis. "Why
do you get us all into such scrapes, you inconsiderate, duped
Hotspur?"</p>

<p>"Because I am in love, most beautiful; they say it affects the
intellect. So tell me what we are to do now."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;would you like to give me up?"</p>

<p>"Don't," prayed the lover, with an imploring gaze at his
goddess. "Say something cheering, for&mdash;eh! it <i>was</i> warm in
there."</p>

<p>Lyndis nodded her beautiful head sagaciously, passed her hand
over Roscoria's forehead, smoothing it, and smiled to herself to
see how his countenance cleared under the comfort.</p>

<p>"Dear one, to me you are an Immortal," he said, reflectively;
"but&mdash;if you <i>have</i> an age, what might it be?"</p>

<p>"That will not do," said Lyndis; "a minor I am, and a minor
I fear I shall remain for a year or two more. But if you will
wait&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Louis threw out his arms with a gesture of impatience. "I
had rather run away with you at once," he said. "Let us
elope."</p>

<p>"Mr. Roscoria, what a very rash idea!"</p>

<p>"Should you refuse, if I asked you?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Lyndis, thereby giving her lover much hope.
"And now, as I am really angry with you, you may go."</p>

<p>"Yes, goddess; but I will hear thee again on this matter.
May I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Lyndis did not expressly say he might not, so he did&mdash;that is
to say, he kissed the golden head that was resting on his rough
coat, from whence it was raised with tumbled bright hair spread
abroad like the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Tregurtha and Rosetta meantime had been looking over a
hedge, commenting on scenery, the weather, and the crops.
Rosetta was a born farmer. The sailor asked her tentatively:</p>

<p>"Did you agree to this plan of marrying my friend Roscoria?"</p>

<p>"I did," said the maiden, brightly.</p>

<p>"But surely you scarcely knew him well enough to love him?
There must have been a strong elective affinity&mdash;or, bless me!
I can't account for it."</p>

<p>"Love him! I never had spoken to him," laughed Rosetta.</p>

<p>"You would not have given him your hand without your
heart?" persisted Tregurtha, with a strange, pained look, which,
alas! she did not understand.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. If I had added my heart, think how great the
sacrifice would have been. As it was, it was <i>very</i> amusing."
Rosetta laughed again, at Roscoria this time, who came up to
apologize for the awkward position in which he had stupidly
placed her.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mr. Roscoria," answered she. "I love adventures,
and I owe this one to you. Only next time you ask
for Miss <i>Lyndis</i> Villiers, let me advise you&mdash;'<i>see that you get
her</i>.'"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME.</p>


<p>For a fortnight after this failed attempt Roscoria beat his
brains in vain to hit on a method of squaring the admiral. He
was debarred from any sight of Lyndis herself, for Sir John,
cleverly enough, had spirited the goddess off to her mother in
London, so that her lover might chafe in the chains of his exacting
profession until perhaps, being unable to follow, he
might cease to love her.</p>

<p>Having executed this little piece of justice on his sworn foe
Roscoria, the admiral turned mighty good-humored, and found
that he lacked a companion over pipe and bowl. As he had
quarreled for life with almost all the residents in Devonshire, it
was natural that the choleric but cheery old fellow should turn
his eye on Dick Tregurtha&mdash;a stranger, a sailor, a pleasant companion,
and a man who could oppose a front of imperturbable
and respectful good-humor to any high-handed impertinence
which the admiral's temper might offer him.</p>

<p>This distinction suited Tregurtha uncommonly well. He
liked the admiral, and he liked the admiral's niece. He did not
see much of Miss Rosetta Villiers, for that damsel was always
either attending to the farm or preparing for an examination.
But she occasionally looked in upon the men, and had bright
smiles for Richard, and a plate of fruit sometimes. She teased
the admiral (who was completely under her rule). Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
evidently liked and understood Rosetta. Lyndis was a complete
puzzle to him. He could appreciate a fine woman; but Lyndis
was more; she was a fine lady, and far too calm-spirited for the
admiral's taste. She was afraid of him and his imperious way,
and he knew it, and took a malicious pleasure in avenging himself
on her indifference by startling projects of matrimony for
her, accompanied by violent reprimands, which Lyndis took
with a calm disdain coupled with fear.</p>

<p>Now, when he presumed to scold Rosetta, she first would melt
into a regular child's fit of tears (which used to cause the admiral
to clear his throat and blink his eyes, and retract certain
over-fierce expressions); then she would flash into a little Spanish
passion, pay the admiral back in some of his own coin, with
the genuine stamp upon it, and quickly send him to the right-about.
And this the admiral understood too, for he was a man
who knocked under with a good grace when fairly worsted.
Tregurtha was never weary of hearing the two joke together,
and noting occasionally how, when the admiral wickedly strove
to turn the joke against Rosetta herself or her sex, the young
lady would throw her uncle a glance of her black eyes that
shone with such masterful warning that the old commander
would cough and change the subject, whilst Rosetta broke into
a young, irrepressible laugh of victory.</p>

<p>Tregurtha commended himself to the lady by offering his help
in the mathematics she required for her examinations. The
logic which she also studied was at first beyond his ken, but he
got over that difficulty by causing Roscoria to give him a fearful
jorum of Jevons every evening, which he then passed on to the
pretty student. Rosetta was much impressed; she marveled at
the wide and varied talents of a mind that had remembered all
the details of logic during a rough seafaring life like Tregurtha's.
But if she admired his qualities, how was he affected by hers?
Ah! that's the worst of it, always.</p>

<p>For, said Dick to Roscoria one afternoon, as that distinguished
preceptor was on the point of joining his adoring disciples:</p>

<p>"Wish me good luck, old comrade: I am off on a forlorn
hope."</p>

<p>"That child?" cried Roscoria, dropping an armful of the
Clarendon Press series with resounding bang upon the floor.</p>

<p>"That child!" intoned Tregurtha, mechanically, with the
voice of a captive spirit from a tomb. "I feel it is utterly hopeless
madness; but I shan't be ashore much longer, and I must
go to sea with a certainty behind me. I was never a man to go
doubting when knowledge could be had for the asking. So I'll
go and have my mind set at rest. I shall be satisfied this evening,
I trust, and then I'll come back to you, Roscoria."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are sure of me, at any rate. I'm afraid you are
making a mistake, old fellow; but I dare say you can't help it."</p>

<p>Pythias whistled sympathetically as Damon went out by the
window with his hat over his brows and his teeth set.</p>

<p>Rosetta Villiers was playing about in the admiral's garden.
At least, she thought she was working, but the sun was hot and
there was a pleasant shade under that chestnut-tree. So she left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
off weeding and tying up roses, and sat dreamily down on a
wooden seat to divide her attention between a book and a flitting
dragon-fly. Tregurtha came walking informally through
the garden, for was he not hand-in-glove with the admiral?
Rosetta looked up brightly, extended her hand to Jevons in
smiling appeal, and pointed to the other end of her rustic sofa.</p>

<p>"I'm not up to logic to-day, dear Miss Villiers," said Tregurtha,
with quiet despondency; "I have brought you a problem
harder to solve than any in that class-book of yours. Do
throw it over the hedge for half an hour, for indeed it is not
opportune!"</p>

<p>Rosetta's astonishment was instructive to see. She clasped
the book tighter and said, breathlessly: "You are strange, Mr.
Tregurtha. Sit down here, and please don't look at me like the
reproachful manes of my grandfather! There, at any rate, it
is only a despairing profile that I see&mdash;the full face was unendurable."</p>

<p>"Just allow me," said Tregurtha, and he put Stanley Jevons
into his pocket. "There! now I have no rival save the landscape.
I say, listen, Miss Villiers. I&mdash;oh! but you will never
understand&mdash;you will not understand!"</p>

<p>"I will do my best," said Rosetta, with a childish touch of
pride. "Am I so stupid?"</p>

<p>"My little Rosetta, no!" cried Tregurtha, with an excess of
tenderness which overwhelmed him; "but this is something
which mere cleverness will never teach you, and which I cannot
explain to you. Roscoria could have done it," he sighed, "but
I am an inferior creature; besides, I shall only be speaking out
my own disappointment. Well, best have it over; after all it
won't take long. Rosetta, how do you think of me?"</p>

<p>"As my friend," answered Rosetta, promptly.</p>

<p>"Ah! and all the time I am only your lover!"</p>

<p>"My lover!"</p>

<p>"Say what you like now, I am ready," groaned Tregurtha,
with hopeless resolution.</p>

<p>There was a long, dreary pause. Rosetta sat still, gazing
away over the sunny lawn, and Tregurtha cared not even to see
her answer in her face&mdash;he knew it; he looked before him also,
and listlessly their thoughts dwelt on the daisies, the butterflies
playing above them, the shifts of light and shadow, and the
birds' half dreamlike song.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is dreadful!" Rosetta at last broke out. Richard
drew her nearer, and kept his arm round her, saying quietly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry I distress you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I could suffer anything! I wish anything evil
could have happened to me, if only I might not have hurt you
so! I did not know it, Richard, I did not know it!"</p>

<p>"No, of course I saw that. You are no flirt, sweetheart, or
you would never have been troubled with me. Oh, well, it is
over now&mdash;the worst part at least&mdash;and you must not be too
soft-hearted, darling; you will have to break some hearts soon,
so steel your own!"</p>

<p>Rosetta gave a long, long sigh, like a child roused from deepest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sleep. All this was so new to her, such a revelation of
pathos, and herself so helplessly ignorant and unprepared, that
she had never a word to say, and all her sixteen bright years of
life seemed unreality before this woeful fact&mdash;her lover. Involuntarily
she laid her head upon Tregurtha's shoulder as if
he could help her; then, with a start, as she felt the tremor
that went through him at her touch, she raised it up, and bent
her startled eyes upon him while she said, so low, with such an
effort:</p>

<p>"I ought to try and tell you why I cannot&mdash;marry you.
But what am I to say? I can find nothing reasonable. You
would in your turn fail to understand the fancies of a child like
me."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear," said Tregurtha. "Talk to me as long
as you will; say what you please to me; I should like to take
back some little knowledge of you, instead of the shadowy hope
which has now gone to range itself with the endless mass which
space is not great enough to hold&mdash;men's illusions."</p>

<p>His bitterness seemed to make his distress so real for Rosetta
that she gave a deprecating cry and struggled with herself for
several moments before she found the heart to continue speaking.
Then tremulously she asked:</p>

<p>"Should you care to marry me before I could love you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Tregurtha. "Now I am bewildered by
my own love for you."</p>

<p>"Listen, Mr. Tregurtha. I am only sixteen, as you know, and
childish for that age. I have lived so much alone and so wrapped
up in my examinations and out-of-door pursuits that I simply
have never yet had occasion to think of marriage. You see,
I have no lady relatives, except Lyndis&mdash;and she is so serious! I
imagined love would find its own way to me, without my playing
with it beforehand. <i>Now</i> I see it needs practice."</p>

<p>"Did the admiral never warn you of your future lovers?"
here put in Tregurtha, with some incredulity.</p>

<p>"Oh, the admiral! Who cares what the admiral says? He's
an old sailor, what can you expect? They think of nothing else
in connection with us women."</p>

<p>Tregurtha gave vent to a dismal chuckle at Rosetta's not altogether
far-fetched aphorism on the navy. He was scarcely in
a position to controvert it.</p>

<p>"And so you paid no attention?"</p>

<p>"Not much," said Rosetta, blushing. "At least I never dreamt
that a man would love me yet, and that I should not be able to
return his sentiment. I relied for the contrary on my southern
nature, and troubled my head no more about it. Indeed, I used
to think that I should like to have a lover, and now&mdash;now he is
come!" And Rosetta covered her face and broke into low, sad
sobbing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor little child! And I have done you harm, blundering
into your charmed circle of heart-freedom! What a
shame it is!"</p>

<p>Tregurtha rose up from his seat, and stood stretching his arms
out with a laugh of self-directed irony; before this good and innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
girl, with all her sorrow for him, he felt utterly baffled,
hopeless, and cast back.</p>

<p>"Let me try to explain myself further," pleaded Rosetta, with
as much eagerness as if it were her fault that she could not love
Tregurtha.</p>

<p>"See, I am happy here. To some people it is not given to
know when they are happy, but I do know. I rejoice in my existence.
I want nothing save that love which is beautiful in
poetry and tragical in life. Here I am useful; you know the
admiral&mdash;his dear, quarrelsome ways&mdash;who can keep him in
order except me? Why, if I did not act as his interpreter there
would never be a farm laborer on the place: every plowboy
and cowman on it would give the admiral notice to-morrow&mdash;if
I did! Here is my home, too; I love it. I love every corner
of this old-fashioned garden&mdash;the corner where the winter violets
grow, the nooks to find snowdrops in, and the borders with
the scented pinks and heart's-ease in irregular places. I look for
each flower as it comes out, and I scarcely care to stray outside
our sweetbrier hedge."</p>

<p>"Well, dear child, all I can possibly say is, that it all sounds
very pretty. If I were not your lover, I should exclaim, 'How
simple are her tastes! what innocence and what content!' I
should look on, were another in my place, and say complacently,
'Here is at last a woman who does not court men's admiration.
Here is a fair maid who prefers Jevons' "Elements of
Logic" to Debrett's "Peerage," and a bunch of mignonette to a
tiara of diamonds.' How new, how picturesque, and how refreshing!"</p>

<p>Rosetta gazed in blank wonderment at the imbittered Richard,
who, with arms folded and a caustic frown, was haranguing
away as if to conjure from him a whole army of demons.</p>

<p>She was not of a mold to stand by and see another really
suffer.</p>

<p>"I will do something for you, Richard!" she cried at length.
"My lover shall not think me hard. I will go with you, Richard,
and let the admiral and the cowman console each other.
Between you and your friend it seems as if I were never to be
left alone. Well, I am ready; I have plenty of spirit, and I say
I will learn the meaning of this love which has made a
hypochondriac of my sailor friend. I will be your wife and
try to make the best of it&mdash;if it will make Richard himself
again."</p>

<p>She stopped, excited but steadfast. Tregurtha, with a last
laugh of amused wretchedness, said:</p>

<p>"Senorita! no one could deny that you are brave and ready;
but beware of your adventurous spirit. You are forgetting
what kind of a man it is to whose rescue you would hasten.
Why, I would sooner a shark should devour me on my next
voyage than that I should have to think of you as a patient
martyr&mdash;you, my&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash; Oh, good gracious, what a fool I
am! My dear Rosetta, go back to your happiness. When the
Fates mean you to love, you will&mdash;and then&mdash;I envy the man!
But till then, recollect that there is nothing so hopeless as mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
heroism. Shun it, pretty one, as you would all evil; for
it is a peculiar danger to you women. My darling, shall we
shake hands? for I am going."</p>

<p>"And you will not come again? I shall miss you so!"</p>

<p>"I'll write and let you know about that," said Tregurtha.</p>

<p>She stood opposite him, murmuring pathetic words in Spanish.
Then she caught her breath, and was silent. A man who knew
her less would have thought she really loved him.</p>

<p>"Richard, you should have waited, I believe!" she exclaimed,
as by sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"While there is life there is hope; but in sailors, they tell me,
there is not always constancy," meditated Rosetta, aloud.</p>

<p>"Not always, dear; only sometimes. Once would be enough
for us. But do you know where you are leading me? For
Heaven's sake, Rosetta, don't say anything you do not mean!"</p>

<p>"I take back my words, Richard. Perhaps I lost my way in
this darkness. I am not well informed in these matters."</p>

<p>"No, dear, so I see," answered Tregurtha, gently, as the high
hope of an instant died in his breast forgotten.</p>

<p>"And you have my 'Logic' still in your pocket," suggested
Rosetta, melting again into tears.</p>

<p>"So I have! There&mdash;don't cry any more to-day. To-morrow
I give you leave to cry, because you will then have forgotten
all about it. Shall I tell you, senorita, who should have been
your lover instead of me?"</p>

<p>"Please," whispered Rosetta, ashamed but curious.</p>

<p>"Job," said Tregurtha solemnly; and, the sailor nature being
too strong for him, he kissed her lips, then left her under her
chestnut-tree and went away, nor ever looked behind him.</p>

<p class="center">THE WAY WE BEHAVE WHEN WE ARE YOUNG.</p>


<p>It was past midnight, and the summer moonlight sparkled on
the waves as a little boat, with its sail puffed out by a brisk
breeze, came gliding, conspirator-like, toward that part of the
Braceton domain that runs along by the sea.</p>

<p>It was the night after Roscoria's school broke up, and the
first use the master made of his holiday was this&mdash;to arrange
to run off with Miss Lyndis. There seemed nothing else to be
done; the admiral would not yield, the lady would not change
her mind, and the lover would not be content to wait. So
the young people exchanged letters, and the result was this
boat. Tregurtha was in the affair as well, though he strongly
disapproved of it. His love of adventure had conquered his
conscience; and he was, besides, confident that Roscoria
would end all by a blunder if not backed by a cool-headed
friend.</p>

<p>So here was Tregurtha, steering the boat into a certain safe
and sandy cove well in the shadow, where he knew that the eye
even of an admiral could not penetrate, whilst Roscoria fetched
his lady. Roscoria's heart was on land before his legs, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and again had he mounted in spirit up that steep pathway, up
the cliffs from the beach to the side of the house, where there
would be one light in a window, one wakeful inmate to steal
out to him through the unbolted shutters and the gate she would
have left ajar.</p>

<p>"Are we late?" he asked his friend.</p>

<p>"No, early," said Tregurtha.</p>

<p>"Will she be ready?"</p>

<p>"I have no means of knowing, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>"What are we to do if she is not?"</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>The boat ground on the pebbly beach, and Dick admonished
the lover <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;now <i>don't</i> sentimentalize on the way; every minute
is valuable; the admiral is not deaf, and the lady's box is sure to
be heavy."</p>

<p>Roscoria was off like a chamois-hunter. Tregurtha sat on the
beach and smoked a pipe, stretching his legs in great tranquillity.
Not that he was ignorant that Rosetta's window also had a light
in it, but he knew it did not shine for him, and, considering all
things, he thought it wiser to look in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It was soon, in reality, that two figures began to descend the
cliff-path. Roscoria first, bearing a modest trunk on his shoulder,
and looking back each moment to see if Lyndis knew her
way in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Lyndis herself was muffled up in a large cloak. She did not
seem at all nervous. All that Tregurtha noticed, as she stepped
into the boat and bade him "good-evening" with a sort of pathetic
courtesy, was that her figure stood straight and firm, and
that she trod the rocks in the uncertain light with Devonshire
decision.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was secretly a trifle shocked by the coolness of
the young couple. Feeling himself the incarnation of duplicity
and insubordination, he would have liked a more remorseful attitude
in the fugitives themselves.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Villiers?" said Tregurtha, doffing his
sou'-wester politely, and at that moment he chanced to look up
at the house and saw the little solitary light go out.</p>

<p>Rosetta also had found a fearful joy in the adventure. She
would dearly have liked the moon-lit row for herself, or, failing
that, would fain have waved her hand to Richard&mdash;but here
conscience stepped in. She therefore watched the party from
behind her curtain until she saw them safely into the boat, and
took a last critical glance at her own lover, preferred him to
Roscoria, blew out the light, and&mdash;probably went to sleep; for
indeed she had quite cheered up, and Dick had been right in
saying that she would only weep one day for his sorrow.
Tregurtha smiled mournfully to himself as he reflected that the
fiery southern natures may excel us in warmth of feeling, but
we of the colder north can beat them in constancy.</p>

<p>They pulled off from shore, after a few instants of great
anxiety, because of the pebbles' traitorous noise; and then they
made an energetic start. The thoughts of the trio were concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
on putting distance between themselves and the
possibility of pursuit. Lyndis steered until the men lost their
first vigor, when she took the place of one of them and rowed
with the enterprise of an ancient Ph&oelig;nician. At first she felt a
delicacy taking thus active a part in the escape, but this finally
vanished when she looked at Roscoria spreading out his
cramped fists in smiling relief whenever she stood up to take his
oar.</p>

<p>They had passed the sharp cliff "Gallantry Bower," and began
to feel the creeping shiver that heralds the dawn. By the mixed
and twinkling light from the fading moon and the glimmering
east they were thinking they could discern a suspicion of white
houses in the bay for which they were making, when Roscoria,
who happened just then to be resting with his hands on the
rudder-lines, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"By Heaven, I see a boat!"</p>

<p>"No supernatural phenomenon upon the sea," said Richard,
looking out, however, with some uneasiness. Lyndis heaved a
deep sigh, and failed for the first time to draw her oar through
the water.</p>

<p>"Well, we have the start, if it should be the admiral. It is a
case of speed, and the devil take the hindmost. Oh, good
gracious, Lyndis! I forgot he was your relation! Change places
with me again, and guide us well in the small bay there. Pull
for our happiness, Tregurtha!"</p>

<p>On land! The three voyagers broke into varying expressions
of relief.</p>

<p>"By Jove, I feel as if I had been reading the 'Agamemnon!'"
cried Roscoria, stretching out his arms, exhausted.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" said Lyndis.</p>

<p>"Good," said Dick.</p>

<p>The cold morning light was growing brighter and more encouraging
as, after drawing the boat high on to the shingle, the
trio proceeded quickly toward a certain white and towered edifice.
As might be expected, this was their goal&mdash;a church.
Lyndis looked rather blankly as they approached this termination,
and lagged behind with Roscoria.</p>

<p>"Would you two mind walking in front?" sang out Tregurtha
without looking round, but with a sternness caused by his sense
of complicity. They did so, and the wedding procession moved
on much quicker.</p>

<p>At the church gate they were greeted by Eric Rodda, the
curate here. He was so ingeniously unselfish (<i>i.e.</i> self-tormenting)
a man that he had insisted on being the one to give his
loved Lyndis to the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Well, every man has his particular fancy; but it puts <i>me</i> in
a precious unpopular position," Roscoria had thought, whilst
accepting the magnanimity.</p>

<p>"All right?" asked Rodda then of his patients, victims,
clients, or whatever those wights are called on whom the parson
pronounces the matrimonial benediction.</p>

<p>"For the present," replied Roscoria.</p>

<p>"Then come along," said Eric, and he led the way into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
little rustic church. It was a picturesque old-fashioned place,
evidently the resort of the ritualistic, for there were lighted
candles on the altar and great bunches of scented flowers. The
flowers lent a charm to the church and gave a memory of the
fresh outer air, from which one is apt to feel so desolately shut
out when encased within consecrated walls. The candles, also,
were much needed, for the windows were stained in such deep
red and purple tints that an early morning sun could hardly
pierce the painting. The people present at this unconventional
wedding were, besides the chief couple and their "best man,"
Tregurtha, Eric, the parson, who now surged gorgeously in
from the vestry with flowing gown and ponderous prayer-book;
the elderly and orthodox clerk or verger, who followed with a
mien of severe desire to see a tiresome ceremony properly performed;
then, lastly, an aged crone, of the sweeping and dusting
persuasion, on whose neck Lyndis would fain have wept, in
default of another woman. But our brides shed no tears nowadays.
The times are undemonstrative, and thus the drooping
veil, whose original use was to conceal unbecoming traces of
tears, now only serves to soften the marble rigidity of resignation.
Who that has once seen it can ever forget the Iphigenia-like
air of beauty at the hymeneal! And then the wretched
bridegroom! Whether he stands trembling before the statuesque
bride, or kneeling, with the shiny soles of his patent-leather boots
in view, what an advertisement to his bachelor friends against
matrimony!</p>

<p>The present wedding was more cheery than most, however.
Roscoria was fairly cool, but that was partly because he had not
been able to afford a new coat for the auspicious occasion.
Lyndis, to be sure, thought she was marrying (unlike the generality
of brides) a man she loved, and this, moreover, in defiance
of her guardian's wishes&mdash;a circumstance which must have
lent an additional charm to the deed&mdash;Lyndis stood looking
white, white and terrified; all her own rashness and the inevitable
uncertainty of her future filling her thoughts. Her head
was bent and her fingers clasped, and nervously bent back; she
was retaining every atom of her self-control, but saying what
she had to say mechanically, with a low voice, like the echo of
her own sighing through cloister aisles.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my darling!" said Louis in an audible whisper,
just as the clergyman opened his mouth.</p>

<p>"Dearly beloved&mdash;<i>hush!</i>" began Eric Rodda; and even Lyndis,
with all her chastened "amazement," could not resist a
smile.</p>

<p>Tregurtha had given the bride away; Roscoria had at last
found the ring, wrapped carefully up in his fly-book; names
had been duly signed with atrocious pens in the vestry; and
the bridegroom saluted the bride. But to do this last it was not
essential to call in the verger as a witness, so the young people
left Tregurtha and Rodda behind and took a merry run in the
sunshine, down-hill toward the village. And as they danced
along on the dewy grass, with their arms interlaced and their
laughing improvident young faces upturned one to the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
they turned a sharp corner and Lyndis gave a little scream of
horror, for she had nearly fallen into the arms of the admiral!</p>

<p>As long as he lives Roscoria swears, he shall never forget how
he was feeling whilst Lyndis shrank back with outstretched
averting hands, exclaiming tremulously:</p>

<p>"My dearest uncle! this&mdash;this is an unexpected pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Lyndis Villiers&mdash;you wretched woman."</p>

<p>"You are twenty minutes behind the times, Sir John," interrupted
Roscoria, stepping in front of the lady. "Lyndis is
Mrs. Roscoria."</p>

<p>"Have you married her?" gasped the admiral, still too much
done for even to swear.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;did&mdash;I have. Oh, Rodda!" appealed the bridegroom,
as the curate came up with Tregurtha, "fetch the admiral the
certificate, and beg him to be calm for the sake of Lyndis!"</p>

<p>It was evident that the admiral was in great perplexity. He
saw he was too late.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> permitted this, you scoundrel!" he roared, turning
upon Tregurtha with fury. Richard flushed up; he had been
afraid of this. He simply saluted and said, humbly:</p>

<p>"I can only ask your pardon, sir; we have all behaved very
badly."</p>

<p>"Ha! yes, my niece Rosetta knows a scamp when she sees
one. Confound you, sir!" and the admiral turned his back upon
his shamefaced subordinate. He confronted Roscoria, and this
time with a peculiar expression of malicious gratification under
his rage. After all, when your next-door neighbor has run
away with your niece, there is a unique joy in the thought of
how he shall reap the whirlwind. Sir John put up his eye-glass
and surveyed the husband of his niece from head to foot with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Well," said Roscoria, with an air of buoyant courtesy, which
passed but poorly with his stammering, "I'm awfully sorry we
have brought you so far after us&mdash;but&mdash;since you are here&mdash;would
you?&mdash;may we request the honor?&mdash;we have ordered
breakfast at the Red Lion."</p>

<p>That was going too far. The admiral gave one of his snorts,
grasped his cane, and absolutely shook it in the face of the
speaker. In another instant there would have been a row royal,
and the preliminary electric thrill went through the whole party.
Lyndis stepped in. She softly removed Roscoria's protective
hand from off her shoulder, and said with decision:</p>

<p>"Let me speak to him, Louis."</p>

<p>The men withdrew a little as she went across to the infuriated
admiral, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Sir John, dear, we do not want to defy you, and we never
did. But indeed there was nothing to be said against the owner
of Torres, except that he was poor. Was I also poor? Well,
then, I was accustomed to a simple mode of life, and, bless my
soul! that is all I have to fear; there is no starvation in the case.
Perhaps I should have behaved differently; but, dear Sir John,
am I not young? I loved him. And in any case, here I am,
Roscoria's wife. My marriage cannot be overlooked; would it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
be seemly? Why not go home without any scandal, and be
thankful that you are rid of a charge that I fear has been very
troublesome to you. And you will go to the Red Lion first, will
you not? and have some breakfast apart from us. Dear sir,
think of Rosetta's feelings&mdash;and of my inextinguishable remorse&mdash;if
you were to take a chill! Come, let me walk a piece of the
way with you; the men will follow. That you should have come
out on this rough sea so early in the morning! That is the only
thing which shadows my happiness. I do not ask your forgiveness,
but I <i>should</i> like your portrait&mdash;the one in uniform, of
course&mdash;you will send it me, will you not? Yes?"</p>

<p>Lyndis bent her ruffled golden head and looked into his face
with her sweet starry eyes. Now, the admiral had never been
inaccessible to the wiles of lovely woman, and Lyndis had never
before cared or dared to coax him. He began for the first time
to see that there was something else in the girl beyond a fine
figure. And thus it came that he put his hand furtively into
his pocket and said, grumbling and awesome, but relenting:</p>

<p>"You're my own brother's child, unluckily, so here's ten
pounds for your honeymoon. You will remember that I have
made an effort&mdash;and a very considerable one it was, too, for an
old gentleman of sixty&mdash;to bring you back to your duty; if I am
too late, you may blame your own cunning for that, when in
future days you may wish this morning's work undone. Begad,
I will make it warm for your husband! He wasn't set down on
the next estate to mine for nothing. There&mdash;there&mdash;a pleasant
trip to you, girl; I cannot congratulate you on your choice, but
we must hope for the best; good-morning!"</p>

<p>Then Tregurtha discovered that there was only just time for
the newly wedded to breakfast at the inn before the coach should
be arriving which was to convey them to Barnstaple, where
they were to take the train for Penzance. So up the main street
of Clovelly went the wedding party.</p>

<p>The informal little wedding breakfast had a far cheerier air
than the funereal orthodox one. Instead of being presided over by
awful footmen and hired waiters, the quartet was served by
one sympathetic maid, who brought them an honest rustic repast
of eggs and bacon, buttered cakes, and Devonshire cream, tea,
and cider. It was all wonderfully Arcadian, and the little room
was very pretty, with its walls covered with old china, and the
creepers forcing their way in through the open window. Lyndis
shone on the occasion.</p>

<p>Nor was there any time for sentiment, nor any ghastly speeches.
Tregurtha did indeed raise his teacup, with a bow to Lyndis and
a wink to Roscoria, and endeavor to drink its contents off at a
draught, but, burning his mouth, he was forced to desist.</p>

<p>Then Roscoria was bound to pour out a glass of cider, and
say:</p>

<p>"My dear fellows, I am heartily obliged to you, and now let
me propose <i>my</i> toast. (By the way, Tregurtha, have you considered
the pungency of the fact that the Greeks use the same
word 'trouble' and 'wife's relations?') Where was I? Oh,
yes; allow me to propose the health and good-humor and indemnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
from chill, of my revered and feared uncle-in-law. Admiral
Sir John Villiers, K. C. B."</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow," said Tregurtha, reflectively; "I hear him
stamping about overhead. I hope he has got all he wants; I
shall go and take him a stiff glass of grog."</p>

<p>He did so, and returned with a smiling but battered expression.</p>

<p>"Is he any cooler?" anxiously inquired the bridegroom.</p>

<p>"Cooler? Molten lead&mdash;the torrid zone&mdash;a powder-magazine
in full explosion&mdash;the furnaces of Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;are about
as cool as is the admiral at this moment. I should like to see
you two clear out of this, lest he change his mind, and bring
the whole population of Clovelly down upon you."</p>

<p>Lyndis paled visibly and rose.</p>

<p>"How ever did he know we were off?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, how indeed?" demanded Tregurtha of his friend. Roscoria
looked up and Roscoria looked down, and Roscoria finally
admitted in a whispered aside:</p>

<p>"Lyndis was rather fluttered, Dick, and so I kissed her&mdash;by
mistake&mdash;just under the admiral's window."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Good luck to you and your ship, captain!" said Roscoria,
with that air of ill-sustained buoyancy which we all adopt during
the <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i> of parting.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Corydon," said Dick, and wrung his friend's hand.
"Be off, or you'll miss the coach."</p>

<p>Lyndis and Roscoria walked away together up the steep path
to the high road; Rodda had made himself scarce, and Tregurtha
stood alone.</p>

<p>There is an advantage here and there, when your friend marries
and you don't. He keeps a more luxurious table as a rule,
and you are sure of a match-box and hot-water in your bedroom
when you visit him. On the other hand, there is something
eternally gone; the old frank confidence <i>a deux</i> grows
yearly more difficult, and, you can never more be "boys together."</p>

<p>On that day a week later Captain Tregurtha was off again to
sea, in command, in a measure through the admiral's interest, of
a fine ship, the Damietta.</p>

<p>Rosetta, who did not see the captain again before he went,
has taken first-class honors in the Junior Cambridge Exam. of
the year (logic being specially commended), and she has now
entered upon an engrossing project in conjunction with the admiral
for the importation of some "Hereford" white-face cattle
on to the Braceton farm.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir John Villiers bides his time. When Roscoria
comes home to cane his boys he will live to find a rod in pickle
for himself. But little recks the lover of the future thunders,
for he is living under a cloudless sky. Unlike most folk of the
present day, Lyndis and Roscoria have rushed headlong into
matrimony; and if consequences <i>will</i> fall heavy&mdash;why, let
them! they say, as they blissfully, economically, and appropriately
roam amongst the myrtles in the Scilly Isles.</p>
